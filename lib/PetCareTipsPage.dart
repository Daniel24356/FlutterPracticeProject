It’s important that your pup gets everything they need to be happy and healthy.

If you’re a new pet parent or you’re about to adopt a new furry friend, you may be wondering, “How do I take care of a dog?” or “What do dogs need?”

Both are great questions—but where do you start?

First, understand that taking care of a dog is more than just making sure their bowl is full or that they’re walked. You’ll want to create a checklist of everything your furry friend needs in life.

Let's look at all there is to know about taking care of a dog, and how you can be a reliable, loving, and responsible pet parent.

## Train Your Dog

Being a good pet parent means taking responsibility for training your dog.

Dog training is important for pet parents when learning how to take care of a dog.

“Dogs don’t come already knowing how we would like them to behave, so we need to train them so they know what to do,” says Zazie Todd, PhD, a certified dog trainer and founder of Companion Animal Psychology.

Obedience training not only helps instill healthy doggy manners, but it also plays a big role in keeping your dog happy, healthy and safe.

“Teaching a dog to come when called is especially important and can prevent dogs from getting lost or running out into the road,” says Dr. Todd. “[You] can also train dogs to help them cope with things, like going to the vet, that they might otherwise find scary.”

Dog training also helps provide mental and physical stimulation for your pup.

Dr. Todd explains, “Training with positive reinforcement is also a fun enrichment activity for dogs and a way to engage their brain.”

With positive reinforcement training, you’ll praise and/or reward your pup with treats for performing the desired cue.

As a responsible pet parent, you should be including dog training in your daily routine.

Whether it is making your dog sit before feeding them or having them wait for you to walk through doorways instead of allowing them to bolt through, you can create habits that help keep your pup’s manners sharp.

## Make Time For Play

Playtime is an essential part of building and strengthening the bond between you and your dog. It allows you to establish a fun and positive relationship with your dog while also providing them with a productive outlet for their energy.

“Play helps to stop pets from getting bored, [getting] frustrated and developing behavior problems,” says Shermaine Wilson Cox, DVM, an Atlanta-based veterinarian.

Set time aside each day to actively play with your pet.

Jim Carlson, DVM CVA CVTP, owner of Riverside Animal Clinic McHenry and Grove Animal Hospital & Holistic Center in Chicago's northwest suburbs, says, “Dogs are companion animals so it's good for their mental well-being to have positive interaction with their human.”

Not all pets enjoy the same types of play, so you will have to figure out what gets your pup up and moving. This means that you have to experiment with a variety of dog toys.

Have you ever watched your dog roll on the ground, lick her coat or chew at her fur? These are her ways of keeping clean. Sometimes, though, she’ll need a little help from you to look and smell her best. But don’t worry, we’re here to help. Read on for ways to keep your dog’s fur, skin, nails, teeth, ears and paws healthy and clean.

### Bathing Your Dog

The ASPCA recommends bathing your dog at least once every three months, but some may require more frequent baths if he or she spends a lot of time outdoors or has skin problems. Here are some steps to help you get started.

- First, give your pet a good brushing to remove all dead hair and mats, and then put him or her in a tub or sink that's been filled with about three to four inches of lukewarm water.
- Then, use a spray hose, large plastic pitcher or an unbreakable cup to completely wet your pet.
- Take care to not spray or pour water directly in his ears, eyes or nose.
- Gently massage in shampoo, working from head to tail, and rinse and repeat as needed.
- Dry him or her thoroughly by giving your pet a good rub with a large towel. Voila, clean pet!

Dogs with loose facial skin or wrinkles—such as Shar Peis and Pugs—will need special attention. To prevent dirt and bacteria from causing irritation and infection, clean the folds with damp cotton. Always thoroughly dry the areas between the folds.

#### Bathing a Puppy

Some pups think that bath time is a perfect time to act goofy! Young puppies especially will wiggle and bounce all over the place, and tend to nip at bath time. If this sounds like your pet, put a floating toy in the tub with her so she can focus on that rather than on mouthing you.

#### Choosing a Shampoo

Using a shampoo formulated for pets is best. Human shampoos aren't toxic to pets, but some may contain fragrances or other substances that can irritate your pet's skin. Select a product that's specifically formulated for your species of animal, as some ingredients may be harmful when applied to different types of pets. It's always smart to talk with your pet's veterinarian to make sure you're selecting a shampoo that will meet your pet's needs.

#### Protecting Your Dog’s Eyes and Ears During Bath Time

Since shampoos and soaps can be major irritants, ask your vet for a sterile eye lubricant to use during bathing—this will help protect your pet's eyes from shampoo. You can also use a sprayer or a showerhead with a long hose, allowing you to control water flow during rinsing. Avoid shampooing your pet's head altogether by simply using a wet washcloth to gently remove any dirt or debris from his or her face.

Protect your pet's ears, too, by placing a large cotton ball in each ear until the bath is over.

### Brushing Your Dog

Regular grooming with a brush or comb will help keep your pet's hair in good condition by removing dirt, spreading natural oils throughout her coat, preventing tangles and keeping her skin clean and irritant-free. Plus, grooming time is a great time to check for fleas and flea dirt—those little black specks that indicate your pet is playing host to a flea family.

The way you brush your pet—and how often—will largely depend on his or her coat type.

#### Smooth, Short Coats

If your dog has a smooth, short coat (like that of a Chihuahua, Boxer or Basset Hound), you only need to brush once a week. Use a rubber brush to loosen dead skin and dirt and follow with bristle brush to remove dead hair. Polish your low-maintenance pooch with a chamois cloth and she's ready to shine!

#### Short, Dense Fur

If your dog has short, dense fur that's prone to matting, like that of a retriever, brushing once a week is fine. Use a slicker brush to remove tangles and catch dead hair with a bristle brush. Don't forget to comb her tail!

#### Long, Silky Coats

If your dog has a long, luxurious coat, such as that of a Yorkshire terrier, she'll need daily attention. Every day you'll need to remove tangles with a slicker brush. Next, brush her coat with a bristle brush. If you have a long-haired dog with a coat like a collie's or an Afghan hound's, follow the steps above, but also be sure to comb through the fur and trim the hair around the feet.

#### Long Hair That's Frequently Matted

For long-haired pooches, it's a good idea to set up a daily grooming routine to remove tangles and prevent mats. Gently tease out tangles with a slicker brush, and then brush your pet with a bristle

1. Understand that a puppy is an infant dog – not a miniature adult.  
   Adjust your expectations accordingly, considering his physical and mental limitations. Before you know it, he will be grown up!

2. Puppy-proof your house with baby gates, a crate, and/or a pen.  
   Any time the puppy is not directly supervised, he should be in a safe place where he can’t get into trouble. Provide appropriate safe toys for him to chew. Nobody would think of giving a human toddler total freedom in a home, and puppies need the same careful supervision. Eliminating opportunities for accidents and destructive behavior will get you through the puppy phase with most of your stuff intact! This helps make sure that bad habits never get a chance to take hold.

3. Dogs are not born understanding English.  
   The new puppy you brought home two days ago has no idea what the word “no” means. Instead of expecting him to drop whatever it is he’s doing, show him what you want him to do instead.

4. Learn about dog body language.  
   Your dog may not be able to talk, but he can tell you how he feels. This is a good place to start learning what he’s saying: https://www.akc.org/content/entertainment/articles/how-to-read-dog-body-language/

5. Train with high-value treats.  
   You will be amazed at how much harder your dog will work for a tiny piece of chicken breast, cheese, or liver, compared to even premium store-bought treats. Those may work in distraction-free settings, but when the job gets more difficult, you need to bring out the good stuff. Training treats should be soft, so you don’t have to wait for Rover to chew before continuing the lesson.

6. Catch your dog being good.  
   It’s easy to get caught up in scolding when your puppy is getting into trouble, but rewarding him out of the blue for being good lets him know he’s doing the right thing.

7. He’s a dog, not a human.  
   It’s their “doggyness,” not what we think of as their similarity to humans, that makes them so lovable. Dogs don’t think like humans. They do not plot acts of revenge; they are just trying to do what makes them feel happy or safe.

8. Dogs do the things that we reinforce.  
   Those behaviors you don’t like? We usually have ourselves to thank. Owners inadvertently reinforce all kinds of undesirable things, from excessive barking at the doorbell to counter surfing. Keep leaving food within reach on the counter, and your dog will learn that it’s worth his while to check.

9. Learn to be quick with treats and praise.  
   If the treat comes more than a few seconds after your pup has done what you’ve asked, he has no idea what he did to earn it, or you may inadvertently reward the wrong behavior. He’s happy to take it, but you failed to reward what you were teaching.

10. Always be happy when your dog comes to you, whether you called him or not.  
    A common owner complaint is that the dog does not come when called. Never punish your dog when he comes to you, no matter what he did before. Call him in a happy, playful tone and reward big when he gets to you, with treats, a toy, or praise.

11. Keep a positive attitude.  
    If you are getting upset, your dog knows it!

12. Provide the right amount of exercise and mental stimulation.  
    Bored dogs get into trouble. For young puppies, mental stimulation is just as tiring as physical exercise and is safer for their growing bodies.

Your pet’s care is important to you, but there’s so much to keep track of. You already know your pet should be on parasite prevention, get their vaccines regularly, and do more than sit on the couch. But caring for a pet is more complicated than simply checking a couple of boxes.

We’re here to help! Make sure you’re not overlooking these important pet care tips.

#### 1. Pet Obesity Prevention Starts at a Young Age

Pet obesity is unfortunately a common health issue for dogs and cats. About 59% of dogs and 61% of cats in a 2022 survey were overweight or obese. Obesity makes your pet prone to health conditions like arthritis and diabetes.

- Start monitoring your pet’s weight at a young age. Your veterinarian can show you how to “body condition” score your dog or cat, which is the best way to monitor their weight.
- Dogs and cats have different nutritional needs as they move through their different life stages. A puppy or kitten has higher caloric requirements for their size than a healthy adult dog or cat does.
- They also require food that is specifically formulated and labeled for growing animals due to their particular nutritional needs. Underlying health conditions and activity level also impact your pet’s nutritional requirements.
- At all times, make sure you’re feeding a high-quality food that’s approved for the stage of life your pet is in. Your adult animal shouldn’t eat puppy or kitten food unless your veterinarian recommends it.

#### 2. Brushing Your Pet’s Teeth Can Prevent Dental Disease

Don’t forget about your pet’s dental care! Your pet’s teeth might be shaped differently from yours, but they still feel dental pain.

- Veterinary dentists recommend brushing your pet’s teeth with a pet-safe toothpaste daily, as well as getting regular dental cleanings done by a veterinarian.
- If you can’t brush every day, even once or twice a week is better than not doing it at all. Your vet can also help you figure out the best pet toothbrush and dental plan for your dog or cat.
- Some pets may not tolerate the toothbrush, but that doesn’t mean you have to give up on at-home pet dental care.
- Other options for caring for your pet’s teeth include:

#### 3. Arthritis Can Be Spotted Early in Pets

Arthritis is a common issue in pets, particularly in senior pets or those with developmental conditions like hip dysplasia. Earlier intervention may slow progression and improve quality of life for your pet.

- For almost all health conditions, your pet will do better with an earlier diagnosis and earlier intervention.
- More obvious signs of arthritis in pets include limping, swollen joints, and muscle wasting. Both dogs and cats have other signs, sometimes subtle, which usually occur ahead of the more noticeable limping.
- Subtle signs of arthritis in both dogs and cats include reluctance to engage in activities like jumping onto furniture or climbing stairs, decreased energy levels, and reluctance to play. Both dogs and cats may also experience challenges with basic movements, such as getting in and out of cars or lowering their head to food or water bowls.
- If you’re noticing signs of arthritis in your pet, speak with your veterinarian. Two ways you can help slow arthritis include keeping your pet at a healthy weight and looking into joint supplements for dogs or cats.

#### 4. Say Yes to Screening Tests

It may be tempting to decline the recommended lab work at your pet’s wellness appointments as a cost-saving measure.

- Just as your own physician recommends bloodwork and urine testing to monitor your health, your veterinarian will recommend monitoring your pet’s lab work. In young adult dogs and cats

A balanced diet is critically important to your dog’s cell maintenance and growth and overall health. Barring any special needs, illness-related deficiencies, or instructions from your vet, your pet should be able to get all the nutrients he or she needs from high-quality commercial pet foods, which are specially formulated with these standards in mind.

But dogs of different ages have different nutritional requirements. So, how much—or how little—should you be feeding your four-legged friend? Read on to learn what your pet’s body needs at the various stages of life.

### Nutrients Your Dog Needs

Nutrients are substances obtained from food and used by an animal as a source of energy and as part of the metabolic machinery necessary for maintenance and growth. There are the six essential classes of nutrients dogs need for optimum healthy living.

#### Water
- Essential to life, water accounts for between 60 to 70% of an adult pet’s body weight.
- While food may help meet some of your pet's water needs (dry food has up to 10% moisture, while canned food has up to 78% moisture), pets must have fresh clean water available to them at all times.
- A deficiency of water may have serious repercussions for pets. A 10% decrease in body water can cause serious illness, while a 15% loss can result in death.

#### Proteins
- Proteins are the basic building blocks for cells, tissues, organs, enzymes, hormones and antibodies, and are essential for growth, maintenance, reproduction and repair.
- Proteins can be obtained from a number of sources including animal-based meats such as chicken, lamb, turkey, beef, fish and eggs (which have complete amino acid profiles) and in vegetables, cereals and soy (but these are considered incomplete proteins).
- Please note: Do not give your pet raw eggs. Raw egg white contains avidin, an anti-vitamin that interferes with the metabolism of fats, glucose, amino acids and energy.

#### Fats
- Fats are the most concentrated form of food energy, providing your pet with more than twice the energy of proteins or carbohydrates.
- Fats are essential in the structure of cells, needed for the production of some hormones, and are required for absorption and utilization of certain vitamins.
- Fats also provide insulation and protection for internal organs.
- A deficiency of essential fatty acids (such as linoleic acid) may result in reduced growth or increased skin problems.

#### Carbohydrates
- Carbohydrates provide energy, play a vital role in the health of the intestine, and are important for reproduction.
- While there is no minimum carbohydrate requirement, there is a minimum glucose requirement necessary to supply energy to critical organs such as the brain.
- Fibers are kinds of carbohydrates that alter the bacterial population in the small intestine, which can help manage chronic diarrhea in dogs.
- For dogs to obtain the most benefit from fiber, the fiber source must be moderately fermentable.
- Moderately fermentable fibers—including beet pulp, which is commonly used in dog foods—are best to promote a healthy gut while avoiding the undesirable side effects of highly fermentable fibers, like flatulence and excess mucus.
- Other examples of moderately fermentable fibers include brans (corn, rice and wheat) and wheat middlings.
- Foods that are high in fiber are not good for dogs with high energy requirements, and who are young and growing.

#### Vitamins
- Tiny amounts of vitamins are necessary in dogs for normal metabolic functioning.
- Most vitamins cannot be synthesized in the body, and therefore are essential to obtain in the diet.
- Please note that when feeding your dog a complete and balanced diet, it is unnecessary to give a vitamin supplement unless a specific vitamin deficiency is diagnosed by a veterinarian.
- Due to over supplementation, poisoning due to excess vitamins (hypervitaminosis) is more common these days than vitamin deficiency (hypovitaminosis).
- Excess vitamin A may result in bone and joint pain, brittle bones and dry skin.
- Excess vitamin D may result in very dense bones, soft tissue calcification and kidney failure.

#### Minerals
- Minerals are nutrients that cannot be synthesized by animals and must be provided in the diet.
- In general, minerals are most important as structural constituents of bones and teeth, for maintaining fluid balance and for their involvement in many metabolic reactions.

### Weaning and Feeding Your Puppy

If you’re responsible caring for puppies in the first few months of their lives, you’ll need to be prepared to move them from a diet of mom’s milk to regular puppy food. This process of gradually reducing a puppy’s dependency on his mother’s milk, known as weaning, should generally begin between three and four weeks of age and is ideally completely by the time the puppy is seven to eight weeks.

#### When to Wean a Litter of Puppies
- Puppies receive complete nutrition from their mother’s milk for the first four weeks of life
